# Limitations and Improvements

## System limitations
While there are checks for invalid input, some inputs may not be fully checked, and as a result may break the system. Therefore, there may be entries that may not make sense. In addition, the lack of a login system makes it awkward to navigate the application and to know which operations are available to whom.

## Improvements
Feedback for invalid inputs should be improved. Currently, some inputs only give a SQL error without further explanation. This could be improved by including more detailed messages in order to inform the user of what errors they made.
